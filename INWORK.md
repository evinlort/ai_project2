# Product framing and terminology alignment

- Add aggregator overview and glossary in docs: Added README aggregator overview sections (EN/RU) with glossary, flow line, and UI/API note, plus a new test to lock the copy.
- Update API documentation copy to reflect the aggregator language: Added API doc tests, updated descriptions to use buyer request/vendor offer wording, and added placeholder docs for list/profile endpoints.
